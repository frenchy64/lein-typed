# lein-typed

Type checking for Clojure with Clojure core.typed.

## Quickstart

Run `lein typed check`.

## Installation

Use this for user-level plugins:

Put `[lein-typed "0.3.3"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your
`:user` profile, or if you are on Leiningen 1.x do `lein plugin install
lein-typed 0.3.3`.

Use this for project-level plugins:

Put `[lein-typed "0.3.3"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your project.clj.

## Checking

To type check many namespaces, add namespaces to your project.clj like

    :core.typed {:check [my.ns1 my.ns2]}

Then run

    $ lein typed check 
    ...

To type check speific namespaces, provide one or more namespace symbols to `check`:

    $ lein typed check typed-demo.core
    Initializing core.typed ...
    "Elapsed time: 5705.247176 msecs"
    core.typed initialized.
    Start collecting typed-demo.core
    Finished collecting typed-demo.core
    Collected 1 namespaces in 6039.963178 msecs
    Start checking typed-demo.core
    Checked typed-demo.core in 94.891391 msecs
    Checked 1 namespaces (approx. 7 lines) in 6138.087383 msecs

## Type coverage

`lein typed coverage` is used the same as `check`, except information on type annotation coverage
is given. Namespaces are not checked.

Requires core.typed version 0.2.3 or later.

    $ lein typed coverage
    Initializing core.typed ...
    "Elapsed time: 4505.279024 msecs"
    core.typed initialized.
    Start collecting typed-demo.core
    Finished collecting typed-demo.core
    Collected 1 namespaces in 4619.570363 msecs
    Checked 0 namespaces (approx. 0 lines) in 4621.945525 msecs
    Start collecting typed-demo.nil
    Finished collecting typed-demo.nil
    Collected 1 namespaces in 20.48361 msecs
    Checked 0 namespaces (approx. 0 lines) in 20.645363 msecs
    Found 2 annotated vars out of 2 vars
    100% var annotation coverage
